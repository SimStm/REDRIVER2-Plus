# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
where release policy permits it.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Dear ImGui developer panel, opened with F11, with live graphics controls and
  an explained game-debug tab for renderer, streaming, traffic, police,
  mission, vehicle, and road-state telemetry.
- Durable agent guidance, OKF knowledge catalog, and build-file regeneration
  rule for contributor and AI-agent workflows.

### Changed

- Rewrote the project README with fork scope, legal-data guidance, setup,
  build, run, debug, technology, and agent-workflow documentation.
- The F11 developer-panel hotkey now activates on key press and supports both
  SDL F11 identifiers.
- Project-owned PsyCross changes are distributed as an idempotent patch applied
  after submodule initialisation, avoiding a fork solely for this integration.

## [8.0] - 2026-07-02

Upstream baseline for this fork: OpenDriver2/REDRIVER2 commit `b2d8857`.

### Added

- High-resolution fonts and dynamic lighting from street lights.
- An additional car-model slot so all base, non-special car models can be
  visible at the same time.
- Restored lights for spooled objects and the birds previously present in
  Driver 1.
- 64-bit platform support and direct Linux execution on a 64-bit ABI.

### Fixed

- Cutscene car deviation in Car Bomb and Tanner's vertical position on Chicago
  lifting bridges.
- A film-director crash when changing the camera from a car to event objects.
- Civilian cars spawning outside roads, missing sirens, high-pitched horns,
  missing skid sounds, and selected texture artifacts.
- High CPU load in the main menu, plus minor bugs and regressions.
